# Adellian's Fluent Fork GTK Theme
Adellian Fluent is a fork of vinceliuice's [Fluent GTK Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Fluent-gtk-theme) modified to adhere to The Sirio Network's Design Language (SNDL).  
This theme is designed exclusively for Adellian's "Hyprllian" Branch, you could use this GTK Theme outside of Hyprland but we STRONGLY do NOT recommend doing so.  

Installation is handled automatically by Adellian's installation scripts. You're on your own if you wish to use this outside of Adellian.

#### We recommend only using dark mode for any non-hyprland install due to transparency if your compositor does not blur behind windows.
